The code that I have written makes use of char arrays or strings to store the
BigInt numbers. I have created two char arrays to store the two numbers that
a user can enter. Each digit is represented by a single character of 1 byte. I
then created three char arrays sum,difference, and product initialized with
310 elements in case of extra carry.
